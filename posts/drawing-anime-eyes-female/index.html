While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=eyes---mainly-anime--chart-by-neongenesisevarei-on-deviantart--girl>Eyes - Mainly Anime- Chart By NeonGenesisEVARei On @DeviantArt | Girl<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#eyes---mainly-anime--chart-by-neongenesisevarei-on-deviantart--girl>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/66/6c/a1/666ca130d6d099d384a0efbaea4d3c5b.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Xfi50uA2en3AXl4ZRN1YcwHaH7&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Eyes - mainly anime- chart by NeonGenesisEVARei on @DeviantArt | Girl"><p><em>Source: pinterest.co.uk</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>When it comes to desktop wallpaper, there are a variety of options to choose from.
