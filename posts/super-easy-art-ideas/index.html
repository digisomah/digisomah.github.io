While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series.
